    "meaning": "DEAF) We live in a constantly changing society, where linguistic proficiency has for long been identified as central to human existence. In recent times, the Government of Ghana, Civil Society Organizations, parents and guardians have given crucial importance to discussions around language development. It is acknowledged that deafness is not merely the absence of hearing. Deaf people across the world have formed themselves into communities that use sign language as a medium of communication and interaction. Across the world and particularly in Africa, 80% of Deaf children are deprived of their rights to quality education and therefore denied their rights to the rich learning environment they need to develop. In Ghana, the number of deaf children accessing basic education has been on the increase. For instance, enrolment in special schools for the deaf has seen considerable increase. At the same time, the number of students progressing to second cycle institutions has improved compared to the past. However, many of deaf children of school going age are left out of formal schooling while teachers and educators struggle to have good grasp of the Ghanaian Sign Language. The Inclusive Education (IE) policy offers greater promises not only for the future of deaf children, but for all children especially the disadvantaged. However, in the context of the deaf child, for the key tenets of the IE policy to be fully achieved, adequate teaching and learning materials are more than needed for participation and improved learning outcomes for deaf children. It is in this regard that this Ghanaian Sign Language Dictionary remains invaluable not only to the children in classroom, but to all teachers who are either teaching deaf children or aspiring to do so. This valuable Ghanaian Sign Language Dictionary forms part of the continuous efforts of the Ghana National Association of the Deaf (GNAD) to promote the teaching and learning of sign language in the country. The book is developed with the understanding that, it is only when the language of the deaf community is understood that inclusion and acceptance of diverse learning needs (in this case, deaf child) would be achieved. Built on past efforts and work of the association, the dictionary has been designed to be user friendly by all. Though not exhausted, the dictionary begins with an introduction taking the readers to the manual alphabets, followed by basic daily sign language. It then takes the reader through various themes such as family, community, etc, making it more effective and easy to use by the reader. It is the sincere hope of GNAD that, heads of schools including special schools, teachers, Ministry of Education/Ghana Education Service, Healthcare persons and the public will find this book user friendly and valuable.

    "meaning": "Fingerspelling is used to spell out names, or if a word is short, the sign may in fact be fingerspelled. It is a very useful tool at your disposal, especially when you cannot think of a sign. You can simply ask “How sign?,” then fingerspell the word to get your answer. As a beginner, this will be a very effective method to help build your vocabulary. But first, there are a few rules when fingerspelling: • STABILITY One of the most important aspects of fingerspelling is keeping your hand steady. If you are bouncing your hand with each letter, the receiver’s eyes will easily fatigue and he/ she will not understand what you are spelling. Imagine trying to read individual letters on a ball as it is bouncing. You can practice this by placing your non-dominant index finger against your signing wrist. This will prevent your arm and hand from bouncing as you spell. • CLARITY The next important rule of fingerspelling is clarity. You should take time to make each of your letters clear and precise, otherwise the receiver may misunderstand you. It is always better to sign slowly and be understood than to be fast and sloppy. • SPEED Another aspect of fingerspelling is speed. Just as words flash before your eyes without having time to process them, individual letters during fingerspelling are easily missed. As a general rule, always start spelling the word slowly, giving a slight pause between each letter. You may gradually increase the pace throughout the word, just make sure the receiver can understand the individual letters. • MOVEMENT The last rule entails movement. When fingerspelling words, you should move your hand slightly to the right for each individual letter. This will help visually break up the word for the receiver. Also, for particularly long words, it is important to pause at times during the spelling to let the receiver process the letters. For example, when fingerspelling the word INTERMEDIATE, you should pause at certain points:",
