# 🧠 EduSign AI

**Bridging the Communication Gap with Artificial Intelligence**

---

## 🌍 Overview

EduSign AI is a bi-directional AI communication platform designed to connect deaf and hearing individuals in real time. It translates **speech and text into sign language** and also interprets **sign language gestures into speech and text**, powered by deep learning, computer vision, and 3D avatar technology.

Whether in classrooms, workplaces, or online meetings, EduSign AI ensures that everyone — regardless of hearing ability — can understand, participate, and communicate effortlessly.

---

## 💡 Problem

Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals often face barriers in education, meetings, and daily life. Existing captioning tools only cover text, missing the full expression of tone, emotion, and gesture. There is a global need for an accessible solution that enables **two-way communication** between signers and speakers in any environment.

---

## 🚀 Solution

EduSign AI bridges this gap through an intelligent system that:

- Recognizes **speech and text**, converting them into expressive sign language via a **3D avatar**.
- Understands **sign gestures** from users and converts them into **spoken or written language**.
- Displays **real-time transcripts** alongside the avatar to ensure clarity and learning support.

It empowers full participation in classrooms, online meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams), and social environments — creating an inclusive communication experience for all.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

### 1. **Speech → Sign → Transcript**
- Captures live speech using Whisper AI or Google STT.
- Converts the text into sign language animations via a 3D avatar.
- Simultaneously displays transcripts as captions for learning support.

### 2. **Sign → Speech → Transcript**
- Captures sign language gestures through MediaPipe or OpenPose.
- Interprets gestures into text using a fine-tuned WLASL-based model.
- Converts text to speech and shows a transcript confirmation.

### 3. **Multi-Modal Accessibility**
- Users can toggle transcripts, adjust signing speed, or replay translations.
- Supports multiple spoken and sign languages for global inclusivity.

## 🤖 Model Training

### GSL Sign Recognition Model

Our model is fine-tuned on Ghanaian Sign Language (GSL) with **98.18% validation accuracy** and **98.54% overall test accuracy** across **1,485 sign classes** using the FullI3D architecture.

**Training Pipeline:**

```bash
# Preprocess landmarks (one-time)
python scripts/preprocess_landmarks.py

# Fine-tune with FullI3D architecture (recommended)
python scripts/train_edusign_gsl.py \

    --pretrained-model backend/app/models/pretrained_wlasl.pth \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch-size 8 \
    --base-channels 64 \
    --fine-tune-lr 0.0001 \
    --augment --oversample \
    --loss focal --class-weights \
    --scheduler cosine

# Alternative: SimpleI3D (faster training)
python scripts/train_edusign_gsl.py \
    --architecture simple \
    --pretrained-model backend/app/models/pretrained_wlasl.pth \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch-size 16 \
    --fine-tune-lr 0.0001

# Test model
